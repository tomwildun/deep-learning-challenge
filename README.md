Module 21 Challenge

The target variable for the model is "IS_SUCCESSFUL". All remaining features are in the model with the exception of 'EIN' and 'NAME' as they were not needed for analysis.
I chose to use X layers. First layer consisted of XX neurons, the 2 hidden layers consisted of X neurons. Input layer was determined by the number of features in the data. For each of the hidden layers ReLU activation function was used. The output layer was X neurons and used the Sigmoid activation function.
